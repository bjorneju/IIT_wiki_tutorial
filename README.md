# Isolating complexes and unfolding $\Phi$-structures
## A part of the [IIT wiki](https://centerforsleepandconsciousness.psychiatry.wisc.edu/intrinsic-ontology-wiki/)

This repository is intended as tutorial to understand what is happening under the hood in the process of "isolating complexes and unfolding $\Phi$-structures" within the integrated information theory (IIT). This tutorial is based on jupyter notebooks implementing functionality from [Pyphi](https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi/tree/feature/iit-4.0) but intended to go into the details of the mathematics typically carried out behind the scenes. Keep in mind that the tutorial is best viewed as a part of the [IIT wiki](https://centerforsleepandconsciousness.psychiatry.wisc.edu/intrinsic-ontology-wiki/) as a whole, and if you are not interested in coding yourself, you can see screencasts of the content there. 

For those of you interested in learning more, we strongly encourage you to head over to our wiki to learn more, read the academic papers (for example starting [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14787)), get acquainted with the latest version of pyphi (see documentation and examples for getting started [here](https://pyphi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)), browse other resources  online (for example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hex5katLGk&t=1630s) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIZzxhJXJns)), or get in touch with us. 

To get started on your own, please open your terminal and: 
1) make sure you have anaconda installed with a fresh base environment
2) navigate to a folder where you would like to add the tutorial files
3) clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/bjorneju/IIT_wiki_tutorial.git`
4) step into the folder using `cd IIT_wiki_tutorial`
5) create a new environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml` 
6) activate your environment using `conda activate wiki`
7) and browse the notebooks!


Hope you enjoy!
