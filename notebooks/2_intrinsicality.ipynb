    "## Causal conditioning\n",
    "Together with causal marginalization, causal conditioning, is one of two ways of removing the causal influence of a (set of) unit(s) in a substrate. \n",
    "When we causally condition on a (set of) unit(s), we hold its state constant effectively removing its capacity to change. \n",
    "This makes it so that it no longer has any counterfactual states available to it.\n",
    "Thus, it can no longer be a difference that can make or take a difference---it is no longer \"a difference\" at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, causally conditioning on even a single unit in a substrate alters the powers of any unit that interacts with it. \n",
    "This is because the powers of a set of physical units depends on the probabilities of conterfactual states in all units it interacts with. \n",
    "Therefore, by removing the counterfactual states of a unit, we remove the capacity of any other unit to take a difference from it and make a difference to it. \n",
    "Thus, by conditioning on all units outside a candidate substrate of consciousness, we effectively restrict its remaining causal powers to be over itself. \n",
    "That is, any remaining differences made or taken by the candidate substrate of consciousness are made or taken by units within the substrate itself.\n",
    "This is a first requirement for making the power *intrinsic*."
